# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted a web-based game called "Draw it or Lose it" playable on various platforms. They needed multiple teams with unique names and players, focusing on expanding beyond Android to include Windows, Linux, and Apple devices.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I adeptly summarized the client's needs, project scope, and technical details while ensuring clarity and coherence. I succinctly covered each section, including the executive summary, requirements, design constraints, system architecture, domain modeling, platform evaluation, client-side considerations, development tools, and recommendations. This concise approach effectively presented the crucial information.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document served as a roadmap, aligning project goals and requirements. It guided code organization, structure, and platform/tool selection. The document's insights ensured focused and efficient code development.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to improve something, I'd simplify the "Evaluation" section by using bullet points and concise language to highlight platform characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses for quicker understanding.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I analyzed user needs and incorporated them into the software design by enabling multiple teams, cross-platform compatibility, and smooth gameplay. Considering user needs is essential as it ensures user satisfaction, usability, and a positive experience, leading to better adoption and success of the project.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached software design by understanding client needs and creating a detailed design document. In the future, I'd simplify documentation, use visual aids, emphasize modular design, and maintain close collaboration with clients and teams.
